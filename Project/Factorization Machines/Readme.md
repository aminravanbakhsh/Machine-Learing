### Dataset:
The dataset that we will work on is brought to you thanks to Yektanet (an Iranian digital advertising platform). the labeled ‘training’ portion of the dataset consists of over 4 million data.

### Descrioption:

The characteristics of multi-field categorical data show some unique challenges:
1. Feature interactions are prevalent and need to be specifically modeled.
2. Features from one field often interact differently with features from different other fields.
3. Potentially high model complexity needs to be taken care of.

According to these mentioned problems, normally usual classification models won’t operate well enough on this kind of data. in this article, first of all, we will explain characteristics of our data set, second, we will implement some famous classification algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and so on. Finally we describe and evaluate Factorization Machines method and compare the resualts with other methods.
